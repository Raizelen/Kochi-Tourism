    <h2><u>History of Kochi</u></h2>
    <!-- Sources: wikipedia -->
        <p>
            Kochi is a city located in the Ernakulam District
            in the Indian state of Kerala about 200 km from Trivandrum, 
            the capital of Kerala.
        </p>
        <p>
            For many centuries up to and during the British Raj, the city of Kochi was the seat of the eponymous princely state. 
            Muziris, a centre of global trade somewhere north to Kochi (presently identified with Kodungallur in Thrissur district), 
            traces its history back many centuries, when it was the centre of Indian spice trade for hundreds of years, 
            and was known to the Jews, Arabs, Yavanas (Greeks, Romans), and Chinese since ancient times.
            Kochi earned a significant position in Malabar Coast after the port at Kodungallur (Cranganore) was destroyed by massive 
            flooding of the river Periyar in 1341.
        </p>
        <p>
            The earliest documented references to Kochi occur in the books written by Chinese voyager Ma Huan, 
            during his visit to Kochi in the 15th century as part of the treasure fleet of Admiral Zheng He.
            There are also references to Kochi in accounts written by Italian traveller Niccolò Da Conti, who visited Cochin in 1440.
            Today, Kochi is the commercial hub of Kerala,and one of the fastest growing second-tier metropolises in India.
